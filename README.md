An A-level final coursework project written in Kotlin using Android Studio. Designed for ME/CFS patients specifically, this health app is intended to help monitor your sleep, energy expenditure and nutritional intake. Due to the lack of research and medication for this condition, the best strategy currently is for patients to spot patterns in their behaviour and modify them to discover what results in more/less fatigue. This task is often depleting unto itself and the app is designed to lessen the burden.
