        "Spoons are a proxy measurement for the amount of "
        "energy that you expire throughout the day.\n\n"
        "They are used by people with chronic illness to visually represent "
        "and explain their experience.\n\n"
        "For every task you perform, tap the spoon button one or more times. \n\n"
        "If you slept badly, or are unwell with a non-chronic illness like a cold, "
        "you may wish to tap the spoon a few extra times. "
        "Typically, people with conditions "
        "such as ME/CFS start every day with 12 spoons, but you can change your "
        "maximum number of spoons "
        "to be anywhere from 2-15.\n\n"
        "As a rough guide, below are a few activities and how many spoons "
        "they typically use.
